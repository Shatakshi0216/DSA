## 📅 Daily Practice

I solve DSA problems regularly on:
- 🔹 **LeetCode**
- 🔹 **Coding Ninjas**

The goal is to strengthen problem-solving skills through a wide variety of topics including:
- Arrays & Strings  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Linked Lists  
- Trees & Graphs  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Sliding Window, Two Pointers, and more

---

## 🚀 Goals

- 📈 Strengthen core DSA concepts  
- 🧪 Improve logic building and problem-solving speed  
- 🎯 Prepare for coding interviews and competitions  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java** – primary language for solving problems  
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and daily uploads  
- **IntelliJ IDEA** – go-to IDE for writing and testing Java code

## 📌 Note

Each file is named using the format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-ProblemName.java
```

This helps in tracking the date and question easily.
